My name is Jonathan Hunt, been a locomotive engineer for BNSF Railway for seven years now.
Upon completion of course I hope to work in the Fintech Industry part-time initially as I work nights currently.
I choose FIntech as a career path because the interest was there and its longevity as a career.
